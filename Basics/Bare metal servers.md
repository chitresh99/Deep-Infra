# Bare metal servers

A bare-metal setup, an operating system (OS) runs directly on the physical hardware without a hypervisor in between. There’s no virtualization layer.

 Since there's no hypervisor, bare-metal systems tend to offer better performance, as the OS can directly access all the server’s resources without sharing them with other instances. This is especially important for high-performance applications like large databases, gaming servers, or mining crypto

With bare-metal, you’re typically limited to the resources (CPU, memory, storage) of the actual physical server. You can't dynamically allocate resources like you can in a VM.

if the server is really close to the location the latency is very low
