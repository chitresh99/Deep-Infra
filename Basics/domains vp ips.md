# Domains vs ip's

Localhost is also a domain name
"Localhost" refers to the computer you're currently working on. It's essentially a loopback address that points to the machine itself, allowing it to communicate with itself over a network. In technical terms, the IP address for localhost is usually 127.0.0.1 for IPv4, or ::1 for IPv6.

ipv6
An IPv6 address is the next-generation internet protocol address used to identify devices on a network, replacing the older IPv4 system. It was introduced because IPv4 (which has ~4.3 billion unique addresses) is running out of space.

Structure of an IPv6 Address
An IPv6 address looks like this:
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

It consists of 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits.

Leading zeroes can be omitted: 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334

:: represents one or more groups of all-zeroes and can appear only once in an address.
